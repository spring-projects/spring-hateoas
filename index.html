Create REST representations that follow the [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) principle from your Spring-based applications.

{% capture main_content %}
Spring HATEOAS provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) principle when working with Spring and especially Spring MVC. The core problem it tries to address is link creation and representation assembly.

## Features

- Model classes for link, resource representation models
- Link builder API to create links pointing to Spring MVC controller methods
- Support for hypermedia formats like HAL
