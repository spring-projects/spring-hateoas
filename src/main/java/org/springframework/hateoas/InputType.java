/**
 * Annotation to declare a dedicated input type for a property of an representation model. Input types are usually
 * derived from the property's type or JSR-303 validation annotations. Use this annotation to override the type.
 * <p>
 * Values are usually constrained by {@link HtmlInputType} as most media types align with those semantically. That said,
 * the annotation doesn't prescribe the usage of those and is open for extensions.
